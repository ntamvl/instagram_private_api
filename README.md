### Why did i do the API?

Unfortunately WhatsApp blocked me (Yes, WhatsApp, _sigh..._) and my UUID, so they blocked me the use of any account on my mobile phone. There was a way to bypass it, but it was not a final solution, so I decided to do this.

### What is Instagram?
According to [the company](https://instagram.com/about/faq/):

> "Instagram is a fun and quirky way to share your life with friends through a series of pictures. Snap a photo with your mobile phone, then choose a filter to transform the image into a memory to keep around forever. We're building Instagram to allow you to experience moments in your friends' lives through pictures as they happen. We imagine a world more connected through photos."
